# BBC Coding Kata - Roman Numerals

## Approach

The instructions stated the solution should be submitted in a runnable format, I therefore decided to use a compiled language which would allow me to submit an executable file that could be run without any dependencies.

From the compiled languages on offer, I wanted a language that supported user input and output from the command-line, had a good built-in unit testing framework and would allow my solution to run fast, I therefore settled on Rust.
